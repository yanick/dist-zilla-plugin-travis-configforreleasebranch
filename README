NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Travis::ConfigForReleaseBranch - Create a
    .travis.yml suitable for built branches

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.000_01 of
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Travis::ConfigForReleaseBranch - released August
    11, 2013 as part of Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Travis-ConfigForReleaseBranch.

SYNOPSIS
        ; in your dist.ini
        [Travis::ConfigForReleaseBranch]

DESCRIPTION
    This is a simple Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles plugin to include a
    sensible -- or so this author believes -- ".travis.yml" suitable for
    running Travis-CI jobs <http://travis-ci.org> off of a release branch
    like one generated by the Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::CommitBuild plugin.

    By default, we build against Perl 5.8, 5.10, 5.12, 5.14, 5.16 and 5.18.
    The 5.8 build job is allowed to fail without causing the entire build
    run to fail.

EARLY VERSION!
    Yep, this is an early, early version. No tests, and no flexibility in
    configuration details. Anyone wishing to assist (and faster than this
    author in remedying this sad, sad state of affairs) is more than welcome
    to submit pull requests. Good pull requests are likely to earn the
    undying gratitude of this humble CPAN author.
